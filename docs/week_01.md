# Week 01: Non-trivial preparation

## Store what you learn with Markdown
Markdown is a markup-style language which makes writting technical documents conveniently.  

### Styling
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a *word* or _phrase_.

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a **word** or __phrase__.

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a ***word*** or ___phrase___.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph to create something like this:
> To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
> We said that: 
>> They said @#$%&, and it is not what we want to be corrected in the contract.

### Make a header
Header can be made using different numbers of #-symbol, i.e. # or ## or ### and so on. 

### Insert a code
We can use the pair `` to highlight a code or a code block.

For example, if we want to highly `variable = 9` we can just use a pair of `. But for a code block, we need a pair of ``` as follows:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
To define the above code block is Python-code, we need to put `python` right after the first block of ```.

### Insert a mathematical formula
To insert a formula, we actually need to insert the latex-interpretation of the formula. This can be done easily online with tool such as https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php.

After receiving a latex code for our formular, we just need to put it inside the pair $$...$$ to make it visible in your mardown document.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\left( x^{n} + \frac{x}{n} \right)$$

### Lists
We can organize items into ordered or unordered lists. 

#### Ordered lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
1. first
1. second
1. third

#### Unordered lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
- first
    * first first
    * first second 
        + first second third
- second
- third
