# Release note

## Start on 2019/10/03

* want to use readthebooks first but give up due to a very high difficulty to incorporate markdown into that platform. it keeps talking about sphinx over and over, and i hate that.
* find gitbook which seems to be extremely convenient. not yet try to import image.
