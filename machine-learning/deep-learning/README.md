# Deep learning

Deep learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation.

They are concerned with building much larger and more complex neural networks and, as commented on above, many methods are concerned with very large datasets of labelled analog data, such as image, text. audio, and video.

The most popular deep learning algorithms are:

* Convolutional Neural Network \(CNN\)
* Recurrent Neural Networks \(RNNs\)
* Long Short-Term Memory Networks \(LSTMs\)
* Stacked Auto-Encoders
* Deep Boltzmann Machine \(DBM\)
* Deep Belief Networks \(DBN\)
