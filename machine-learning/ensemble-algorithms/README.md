# Ensemble algorithms

Ensemble methods are models composed of multiple weaker models that are independently trained and whose predictions are combined in some way to make the overall prediction.

Much effort is put into what types of weak learners to combine and the ways in which to combine them. This is a very powerful class of techniques and as such is very popular.

* Bootstrapped Aggregation \(Bagging\)
* AdaBoost
* Weighted Average \(Blending\)
* Stacked Generalization \(Stacking\)
* Gradient Boosting Machines \(GBM\)
* Gradient Boosted Regression Trees \(GBRT\)
* Random Forest
