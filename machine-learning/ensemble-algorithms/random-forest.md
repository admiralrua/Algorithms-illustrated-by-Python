# Random forest

Random forest is a trademark term for an ensemble of decision trees. In Random forest, we have collection of decision trees \(so known as “Forest”\). To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes \(over all the trees in the forest\).
