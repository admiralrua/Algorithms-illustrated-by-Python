# Artificial neural networks

Artificial Neural Networks are models that are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks.

They are a class of pattern matching that are commonly used for regression and classification problems but are really an enormous subfield comprised of hundreds of algorithms and variations for all manner of problem types.

Note that Deep Learning is separated out from neural networks because of the massive growth and popularity in the field. Here we are concerned with the more classical methods.

The most popular artificial neural network algorithms are:

* Perceptron
* Multilayer Perceptrons \(MLP\)
* Back-Propagation
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Hopfield Network
* Radial Basis Function Network \(RBFN\)
