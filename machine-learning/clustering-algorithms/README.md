# Clustering algorithms

Clustering, like regression, describes the class of problem and the class of methods. Clustering methods are typically organized by the modeling approaches such as centroid-based and hierarchal. All methods are concerned with using the inherent structures in the data to best organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

The most popular clustering algorithms are:

* K-Means
* K-Medians
* Expectation Maximisation \(EM\)
* Hierarchical Clustering
