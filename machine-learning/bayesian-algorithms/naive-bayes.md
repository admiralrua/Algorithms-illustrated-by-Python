# Na√Øve Bayes

It is a classification technique based on Bayes's theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. Simply speaking, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. 

A Naive Bayesian model is easy to build and useful for massive datasets. It's simple and is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods
