# Linear regression

In machine learning, we have a set of input variables \($$\mathbf{y}$$\) that are used to determine an output variable \($$\mathbf{x}$$\). A relationship exists between the input variables and the output variable. The goal of ML is to quantify this relationship. In Linear Regression, the relationship between the input variables \($$\mathbf{x}$$\) and output variable \($$\mathbf{y}$$\) is expressed as an equation of the form $$\mathbf{y} = a*\mathbf{x} + b$$. Thus, the goal of linear regression is to find out the values of coefficients $$a$$ and $$b$$ which are the intercept and the slope of the line, respectively.

* Least-squares and polynomial fitting
* Constrained linear regression
