# K-nearest neighbors

It can be used for both classification and regression problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. K-nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors.



Things to consider before selecting KNN: 

* KNN is computationally expensive
* Variables should be normalized, or else higher range variables can bias the algorithm
* Data still needs to be pre-processed.
