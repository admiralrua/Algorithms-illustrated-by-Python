# Support vector machine

Support vector machine \(SVM\) is a method of classification in which you plot raw data as points in an n-dimensional space \(where n is the number of features you have\). The value of each feature is then tied to a particular coordinate, making it easy to classify the data. Lines called classifiers can be used to split the data and plot them on a graph.
