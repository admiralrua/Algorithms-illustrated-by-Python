# Decision tree

This is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in use today, this is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classifying problems. It works well classifying for both categorical and continuous dependent variables.

Classification and regression trees \(CART\) is one simplified implementation of decision tree.

Nice tutorial \([https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/)\).



Decision tree methods construct a model of decisions made based on actual values of attributes in the data. Decisions fork in tree structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record. Decision trees are trained on data for classification and regression problems. Decision trees are often fast and accurate and a big favorite in machine learning.

The most popular decision tree algorithms are:

* Classification and Regression Tree \(CART\)
* Iterative Dichotomiser 3 \(ID3\)
* C4.5 and C5.0 \(different versions of a powerful approach\)
* Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection \(CHAID\)
* Decision Stump
* M5
* Conditional Decision Trees
