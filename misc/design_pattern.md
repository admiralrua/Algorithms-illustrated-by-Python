## A design pattern

### What and Why
- Well-known solutions for recurring problems
- no need to reinvent
- systematic reuse of ideas or best practices yields lower cost and higher quality

### Important characteristics
- language neutral
- dynamic (evolution)
- incomplete **to promote customization**

### Type of design patterns
- creational
  - used to create objects in a systematic way
  - flexibility, i.e.: create different subtypes of objects from the same calss at runtime
- structural
  - establishes useful relationships between software components in certain configurations
  - to accomplish both functional and nonfunctional requirements
  - different goals yield different structures
- behavior
  - best practice of objects interaction
  - focus on defining the protocols of interactions
