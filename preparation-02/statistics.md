# \_notyet\_ Statistics


## Briefing 
[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

This section is heavily based on the following references:

- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
- [The elements of statistical learning](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576) [or here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)



## Statistical data
### Data preparation
The process of data preparation includes several works:

- data collection by experimental study or observational study
- data summarising (aka descriptive statistics) is considered as a problem of defining what aspects of statistical samples need to be described and how well they can be described from a typically limited sample of data; this work includes:
  + choosing summary statistics to describe a sample
  + summarising probability distributions of sample data 
  + summarising the relationships between different quantities measured on the same items 
- data interpreting (aka inferential statistics) finds the philosophy underlying statistical inference by using different data analytic techniques; this work includes:
  + summarising populations in the form of a fitted distribution or probability density function
  + summarising the relationship between variables using some type of regression analysis
  + providing ways of predicting the outcome of a random quantity given other related variables
  + examining the possibility of reducing the number of variables being considered within a problem (the task of Dimension Reduction Analysis)


### Data types
In the most general form, there are two types of data/variables:

- categorical variables: variables conform only to nominal or ordinal measurements which cannot be reasonably measured numerically; and
- quantitative variables: variables conform ratio and interval measurements which have numerical nature, either discrete or continuous.


## Statistical methods
### Descriptive statistics
A descriptive statistic is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a data set. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent. Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types, while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data. The drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. 


### Inferential statistics
Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data (hypothesis testing), estimating numerical characteristics of the data (estimation), describing associations within the data (correlation) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using regression analysis). Inference can extend to forecasting, prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data, and can also include data mining.

#### Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities

#### Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

#### Error

#### Interval estimation

#### Significance

#### Examples
Some well-known statistical tests and procedures are:

- Regression analysis
- Time series analysis 
- Chi-squared test
- Correlation and dependence

### Exploratory data analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
