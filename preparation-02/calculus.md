## Differential calculus
### Briefing
[Differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus) is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change. The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function, the derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

Suppose that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are real numbers and that $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$ meaning for every value of $$x$$, there is a corresponding value of $$y$$. This relationship can be written as $$y = f(x)$$. Geometrically, the derivative of $$f$$ at the point $$x = a$$ is the slope of the tangent line to the function $$f$$ at the point $$a$$ denoted $$f'(a)$$.

$$ f'(a) = \left. \frac{df}{dx} \right |_{x = a} $$

**Reserved for a figure**.

Since the derivative is the slope of the linear approximation to $$f$$ at the point $$a$$, the derivative (together with the value of $$f$$ at $$a$$) determines the best linear approximation, or [linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearization), of $$f$$ near the point $$a$$. The linear approximation of a function is the first order Taylor expansion, which will be described later, around the point of interest.
