# Greedy algorithm

## Briefing

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Therefore, the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for the greedy algorithm otherewise the greedy algorithm will provide the wrong answer.
