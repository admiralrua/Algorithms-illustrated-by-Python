# Backtracking

## Briefing
[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is a general algorithm for finding all solutions of a computational problem that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") if that candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a _partial candidate solution_ and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution. 

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems.

A classic example of the use of backtracking is the knight's tour problem that asks to find a route for the knight to travel all squares of the board once. Another typical prolem is the $$n$$-queens puzzle that asks for all arrangements of $$n$$ chess queens on a chessboard size $$n \times n$$ so that no queen attacks any other. More recently, the Sudoku problem can also be considered as a typical backtracking problem.

## Algorithm
With the backtracking technique, a problem is solved incrementally. We start from an empty solution vector and gradually add items. If the item added violate the problem constraint then we remove the item and try other alternatives for adding. If there is no alternatives then we come back to the previous stage and remove the item added in the previous stage. If we reach the initial stage then actually no solution exists. If adding an item doesnâ€™t violate constraints then we recursively add items one by one. If the solution vector becomes complete then we print the solution. The pseudo-code of the backtracking algorithm can be presented as follows:

```python
solution = {}

def backtracking(solution)
    if (solution == complete)
        print(solution)
        return
    
    for item in possible_item:
        solution += item
        backtracking(solution)
        solution -= item
```

Illustrations of the backtracking algorithm to solve the knight tour problem and the $$n$$-Queen are given here. 

In the first problem, the naive backtracking solution is presented in which we backtrack only when we hit a dead end

In the second problem, we combine the backtracking algorithm with the [branch-and-bound](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/branch-and-bound-algorithm/) technique. After building a partial solution, we figure out that if it is possible to go any deeper or not. By doing that, obvious unacceptatble solutions are eliminated early to save time. In the $$n$$-Queen problem, the branch-and-bound technique can be illustrated as follows:

- no two queens can place on the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines;
- the first constraint can be automatcically satisfied if we place queen line-by-line;
- the second constraint can be tracked by a logical vector length $$n$$, a space of alternatives for the next item is reduced one after each placement;
- the third constraint can be controlled by two logical vectors length $$2 \times n$$ to track the left- and right-inclined diagonals, a space of alternatives for the next item is reduced atleast one after each placement.
