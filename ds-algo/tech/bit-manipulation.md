# Bit manipulation

(To be continued)

## Theory
Let illustrate the bitwise operation by [examples](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/bitwise_operators_example.htm). Assume that $$a = 60 = 00111100$$ and $$b = 13 = 00001101$$. The following bitwise operators are supported by Python language.

| Operator | Description | Example | Output |
| :---     | :---        | :---    | :---   |
| &        | AND: copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands | $$a & b$$ | 13 = 00001100 |
