Dynamic programming is a technique of algorithmic design in which a problem is divided into sub-problems and results of sub-problems are combined into the result of the original problem. Results of a dynamic programming solution are often stored in a table, 1- or 2-dimensional array to avoid recalculation. There are two main approaches followning the dynamic programming technique, the top-down approach and the bottom-up one. 

- the top-down approach (memoization): using recursive technique to find solutions of sub-problems and store them into a table, when the sub-problem is encountered, its solution is taken out without recalculation.
- the bottom-up approach (tabulation): using the loop-statement to solve first sub-problems then the main problem.
