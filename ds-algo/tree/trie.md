# Trie

## Briefing
A [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array. In the [example](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/52Tries.pdf) shown below, a dictionary is stored in a trie with characters are stored in nodes; at some specific nodes storing the last character of a word there is an arbitrary integer value associated with that word.

Applications:

- a typical application of a trie is storing predictive text or autocomplete dictionary;
- to implement approximate matching algorithms used in spell checking;
- to replace a hash table.
