# Tree \[DS\]

One of the very powerful family type of data structures is [**Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29). A tree is a hierarchical data structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree data structure can also be defined recursively as a collection of nodes \(starting at a root node\), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes \(the _children_\), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

Some other data structures which may not exactly be a **tree** but can be considered to belong to the **tree-family** will be briefly presented in this note including:

* **Heap**
* **Trie**
* **Disjoint Set Union**
* **Binary search tree**
* **Red-Black tree**
