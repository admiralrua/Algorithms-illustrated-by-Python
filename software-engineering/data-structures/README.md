# Data structures

There are four basic built-in container types in Python:
* **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable; duplicate members.
* **Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable; duplicate members.
* **Dictionary** is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed; no duplicate members.
* **Set** is a collection which is unordered and unindexed; no duplicate members.

Besides, some data structured as **Linked-list**, **Stacks**, **Queue** are also very powerful and widely used in practice. 

One of the very powerful family type of data structures is [**Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(data_structure\)). A tree is a hierarchical data structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree data structure can also be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the _children_), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root. Some other data structures belonging to the **tree-family** will be briefly presented in this note including:
* **Heap**
* **Binary search tree**
* **Red-Black tree**
* **Trie**

And of course we should mention **Data abstraction** as well, its extension is Object-Oriented Programming mindset which seems to be really convenient but also, sometimes, quite vague. You can find numerous good and comprehensive references about OOP online.
