# Binary search

## Algorithm

[Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search is the most popular and also one of the most commonly used techniques that is used to solve problems. Binary search works only on a sorted set of elements. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must first be sorted. The worst case time complexity of binary search is $$O(\log_2 n)$$.
