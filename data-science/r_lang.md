# Basic of R

## Briefing
This section gives a brief introduction into R-language. 


## Basic data types and structures in R

### Data types
Everything in R is an object. R has 6 basic data types:

| Type | Examples |
| ---  | ---      |
| character                 | "a", "swc"  |
| numeric (real or decimal) | 2, 15.5     |
| integer                   | 2L          |
| logical                   | TRUE, FALSE |
| complex                   | 1+4i        |
| raw                       | _not yet_   |

R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example
- class(): what kind of object is it (high-level)
- typeof(): what is the objectâ€™s data type (low-level)
- length(): how long is it? What about two dimensional objects
- attributes(): does it have any metadata

Numeric variables

```r
x <- 4
y <- 5
z <- x + y
```

Character variables

```r
a <- "hello"
b <- "world"
c <- paste(a, b, sep = " ")                  # this is a function to concate two strings
```


### Data structures
Vector and slicing

```r
x <- c(2, 5, 1, 7, 8)
x[2]
x[2:4]
x[2:length(x)]
x[c(2,4)]                                    # direct slicing
index <- c(2,4)                              # indirect slicing
x[index]
x[x >= 5]                                    # conditional slicing
x[(x >= 5) & (x %% 2 == 0)]
y <- x >= 5                                  # y is a logical variable                    
x[y]
seq(1, 100, 2)                               # different ways to define a sequence
seq(1, 10, length.out = 101)
seq(0,10000000, length.out = 6)
rep(5,20)
rep(c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"), 10)
rep(c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"), each = 10)
```
