# \_notyet\_ Data science

## Briefing
Data Science basically is an amalgamation of mathematics, programming, statistics and design which are applied in order to successfully manage digital data collection.  The main 3 components involved in data science are organising, packaging and delivering data.

As a Data Scientist, one should be adept at using large data sets to find opportunities for product and process optimization and using models to test the effectiveness of different courses of action. He/She must have strong experience using a variety of data mining/data analysis methods, using a variety of data tools, building and implementing models, using/creating algorithms and creating/running simulations. He/She must have a proven ability to drive business results with their data-based insights; and must be comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders and functional teams.


## Scope of work
Responsibilities for Data Scientist include but not limited to:

- perform research on the messy data available and frame questions that needs to be answered by his analysis on the data collected; 
- collect huge data from multiple sources;
- make use of high-end analytics programmes, machine learning and statistical methods to organise data into a predictive model; 
- clean the huge volume of data to discard irrelevant information explore and analyse the data to determine the trends, opportunities and also weaknesses;
- produce data-driven solutions to conquer the most pressing challenges;
- invent new algorithms to solve problems;
- build new tools to speed work;
- communicate the predictions from the data analysed through data visualizations and reports;
- recommend effective changes for the existing strategies to companies.

Main qualifications for Data Scientist include but not limited to:

- Experience using statistical computer languages (R, Python, SLQ, etc.) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets;
- Experience working with and creating data architectures;
- Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks;
- knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications;
- A drive to learn and master new technologies and techniques;
- Familiar with the following software/tools:
  + Coding with several languages such as C, C++, Python, R, etc.
  + Statistical and data mining techniques: GLM/Regression, Random Forest, Boosting, Trees, text mining, social network analysis, etc.
  + Querying databases and using statistical computer languages: R, Python, SLQ, etc.
  + Web services: Redshift, S3, Spark, DigitalOcean, etc.
  + Creating and using advanced machine learning algorithms and statistics: regression, simulation, scenario analysis, modeling, clustering, decision trees, neural networks, etc.
  + Analyzing data from 3rd party providers: Google Analytics, Site Catalyst, Coremetrics, Adwords, Crimson Hexagon, Facebook Insights, etc.
  + Distributed data/computing tools: Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, Gurobi, MySQL, etc.
  + Visualizing/presenting data for stakeholders using: Periscope, Business Objects, D3, ggplot, etc.
