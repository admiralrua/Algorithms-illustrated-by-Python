I am an civil engineer who have a great passion for Computer Science.

Actually, for quite many years, I forgot how fascinate I was when I first touched a computer \(i386\) and had a small code of Pascal \(Turbo Pascal 3.x\) running. Luckily, before turning 40, I have another chance to see Algorithms again and codes much more than I need in a daily work. This starts quite accidentally when I was involved in a project in my company to develop a tool for automation design\[^1\]. Then I started remembering how I love coding and a colleague motivates me looking more into that direction. I took a course\[^2\] in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and I really love it :\) Hopefully, I soon can combine coding into my work more and more. I have no doubt about that.

This note reflects what I am studying on Computer Science.
