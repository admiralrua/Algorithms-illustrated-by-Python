# Preface

## Preface

I am an civil engineer who have a great passion for Computer Science.

Actually, for quite many years, I forgot how fascinate I was when I first touched a computer \(i386\) and had a small code of Pascal \(Turbo Pascal 3.x\) running. Luckily, before turning 40, I have another chance to see Algorithms again and codes much more than I need in a daily work. This starts quite accidentally when I was involved in a project in my company to develop a tool for automation design [\[1\]](./#fn01). Then I started remembering how I love coding and a colleague motivates me looking more into that direction. I took three courses [\[2\]](./#fn02) in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and I really love them :\) Hopefully, I soon can combine coding into my work more and more. I have no doubt about that.

This note reflects what I am studying on Computer Science.

[\[1\]](./): A proof-of-concept tool for Automation Jetty Design in the maritime field.

[\[2\]](./): More information about these courses can be found [here](http://bigocoding.com/). Those courses are highly recommended, not only becasue of their contents and a practical and highly illustrative approach they are delivered, but also because you will have supports from highly trained and enthuastic TAs to have a smooth start with DS & Algo.

## Table of contents
* [Data structures and Algorithms](ds-algo/)
* [\_notyet\_ Machine learning](machine-learning/)

This is the very first preparation. If you already know about Markdown, basic Python and C/C++, you can skip this.

* [Preparation 01](preparation-01/)


 
This is the second preparation including introduction for packages of Python such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib, then introduction to basic mathematical foundation for DS and ML. If you are familiar with these subjects, please skip this section.

* [\_notyet\_ Preparation 02](preparation-02/)

This is the third preparation including basic algorithms for DS and ML. If you are familiar with these subjects, please skip this section.

* [\_notyet\_ Preparation 03](preparation-03/)

Now we come to Machine Learning.



Finally, tips and tricks for Coding Interview.

* [Coding interview](interview.md)
