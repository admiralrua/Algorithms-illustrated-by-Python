# Preface

## Preface

I am an civil engineer who have a great passion for Computer Science.

Actually, for quite many years, I forgot how fascinate I was when I first touched a computer \(i386\) and had a small code of Pascal \(Turbo Pascal 3.x\) running. Luckily, before turning 40, I have another chance to see Algorithms again and codes much more than I need in a daily work. This starts quite accidentally when I was involved in a project in my company to develop a tool for automation design [\[1\]](./#fn01). Then I started remembering how I love coding and a colleague motivates me looking more into that direction. I took three courses [\[2\]](./#fn02) in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and I really love them :\) Hopefully, I soon can combine coding into my work more and more. I have no doubt about that.

This note reflects what I am studying on Computer Science.

[\[1\]](./): A proof-of-concept tool for Automation Jetty Design in the maritime field.

[\[2\]](./): More information about these courses can be found [here](http://bigocoding.com/). Those courses are highly recommended, not only becasue of their contents and a practical and highly illustrative approach they are delivered, but also because you will have supports from highly trained and enthuastic TAs to have a smooth start with DS & Algo.
