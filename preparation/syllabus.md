## Mathematics
### Arithmetics and Geometry
- [x] Integers, operations (incl. exponentiation), comparison
- [x] Basic properties of integers (sign, parity, divisibility)
- [] Basic modular arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and inverse
- [] Prime numbers
- [x] Fractions, percentages
- [] Line, line segment, angle, triangle, rectangle, square, circle
- [] Point, vector, coordinates in the plane
- [] Polygon (vertex, side/edge, simple, convex, inside, area)
- [x] Euclidean distances
- [] Pythagorean theorem


### Discrete Structures (DS)
#### Functions, relations, and sets

- [] Functions (surjections, injections, inverses, composition)
- [] Relations (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, equivalence relations, total/linear order relations, lexicographic order)
- [] Sets (inclusion/exclusion, complements, Cartesian products, power sets)


#### Basic logic

- [] First-order logic
- [] Logical connectives (incl. their basic properties)
- [] Truth tables
- [] Universal and existential quantification (Note: statements should avoid definitions with nested quantifiers whenever possible.)
- [] Modus ponens and modus tollens


#### Proof techniques

- [] Notions of implication, converse, inverse, contrapositive, negation, and contradiction


#### Basics of counting

- [x] Counting arguments (sum and product rule, arithmetic and geometric progressions, Fibonacci numbers)
- [x] Permutations and combinations (basic definitions)
- [] Factorial function, binomial coefficients
- [] Inclusion-exclusion principle
- [] Pigeonhole principle
- [] Pascal's identity, Binomial theorem


#### Graphs and trees

- [x] Trees and their basic properties, rooted trees
- [] Undirected graphs (degree, path, cycle, connectedness, Euler/Hamilton path/cycle, handshaking lemma)
- [] Directed graphs (in-degree, out-degree, directed path/cycle, Euler/Hamilton path/cycle)
- [x] Spanning trees
- [x] Traversal strategies
- [] Decorated graphs with edge/node labels, weights, colors
- [] Multigraphs, graphs with self-loops
- [] Bipartite graphs
- [] Planar graphs


#### Discrete probability

- [] Applications where everything is finite (and thus arguments about probability can be easily turned into combinatorial arguments)
