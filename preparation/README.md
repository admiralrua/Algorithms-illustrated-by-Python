# Preparation

When I start beginning more serious on topics in Computer Science, I used Latex for documentation and Python for coding.

Later, I found Markdown and realized that it is a really convenient tool to quickly note down that I study and put it directly online to share with friends.

I practice coding by solving problems in different coding competition platforms. I sometimes have TLE \(time limit excess\) warning if codes written in Python whereas the same code with the same algorithm/data structures written in C++ is accepted. That's why I think it is good to be \(partially\) fluent in C++ if you want to participate in coding competition to practice your skills. Nevertheless, Python is still used to illustrate the algorithms in this note because of its beauty.

Consequently, this part is to brief about Markdown, Python and C++.

If you are familiar with those three subjects, please move on to the next section.
